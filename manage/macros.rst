Macros
******

Macros make it easy to automate common, multi-step tasks within Zammad. You can use macros in Zammad to automate recurring sequences, saving time (and nerves). This allows a combined sequence of actions on the ticket to be executed with just one click.

In the Macros Management Mask you can add, edit and delete macros:

Adding or updating Macros
-------------------------

By either clicking on an existing macro to edit it or clicking on "New Macro" on the upper right to add new Macros, the macro app will open:

One macro can contain any number of changes to the ticket. In this example you close the ticket, set the owner and tag the ticket - all with just one click!


As of Zammad 2.6, macros can be configured to close the current tab when finished, so you can move straight onto the next ticket without another thought.

This setting is optional, of course, so there’s nothing to worry about if you don’t want your macros to work like this.

Using Macros
------------

You have two options on how to use Macros:

1. In the ticket on the right lower corner. There is an arrow next to the "update" button. All active macros are displayed here:

2. If you want to apply a macro for more than one ticket, you have to select all the corresponding tickets in the overview:

select all relevant tickets, click, hold down the cursor and move it anywhere, like that:

Keep the cursor pressed and go to "Run Macro" so that you can see all active macros:
