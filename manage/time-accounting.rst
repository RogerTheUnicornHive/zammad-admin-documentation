Time Accounting
***************

If you want to know how much time you need for your each project, you can enable time accounting (turn on the switch on the top left side of the page).

It can be set for which tickets the time accounting is activated - that means for which tickets you can enter, how much time was needed. It's possible to set multible conditions (these can also be arbitrarily combined and thus specified):

For all set cases (in this example, this is for each "Update" of tickets that are not closed and in the group 'Sales') the following field appears for entering the invested time:

In the admin area there are different possibilities to get an overview of the accounted times.

There is a monthly overview for all counted times. By clicking on the desired year and month you can see all corresponding tickets:

The tickets can be arranged according to customers and organization. All views can be downloaded as a CSV file (click on the down arrow).
