How to create an App Password for Gmail
***************************************

If you have 2FA enabled on your Google account,
you will need to follow these directions
before you can add your Gmail account to Zammad.

.. hint:: **What the heck is 2FA?**

   *Two-factor authentication*, or *2FA* for short,
   is an addtional layer of security offered by many online services.
   With 2FA, you need both your password and a one-time passcode (usually sent via SMS) to log in.

      If Gmail account setup fails with the error shown above,
      your account has 2FA enabled.

   To use Zammad with a 2FA-enabled email account,
   you‚Äôll need to generate a separate **app password** for Zammad to use
   instead of your normal password.
   (Note that Google will automatically revoke all app passwords
   if you ever change your normal password;
   you can also manually revoke app passwords
   if you suspect they have been compromised.)

   For more information, see `Google‚Äôs official help article on the subject
   <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833>`_.

Step 1: Access Your App Password Settings Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To begin, visit the `App Passwords <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>`_ page
of your Google Account settings, under the Security panel.

.. warning:: üôÖ **Keep your password safe!**

   The page linked above will ask you to enter your Google password.
   **Always always always** make sure that a site is who it says it is before entering your password,
   **especially** when you got there by clicking a on a link in an email or on a third-party website.

      Click on the üîí padlock icon to verify that your connection is secure,
      and check the domain in the URL to ensure
      that the site you‚Äôre giving your password to is really accounts.google.com.

   If you wanted to be *extra* safe,
   your best bet would be to type ‚Äúaccounts.google.com‚Äù into your browser yourself,
   and navigate to the App Password page from there.

   Of course, we‚Äôd never trick you‚Äîbut you can never be too sure.

Step 2: Label and Generate a New App Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Under the **Select app** dropdown menu, choose **Other (Custom name)**.
* Label your new app password *Zammad*.
* Then, click **Generate**.

.. hint:: If you wish, you can actually name your app password anything you like.
          Choosing a name you can easily recognize will help
          if you create many app passwords and need to revoke one in the future.

Step 3: Add Your Account to Zammad Using the App Password
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your new app password will appear on the screen.
Copy and paste it into Zammad‚Äôs :ref:`email account setup dialog <add-a-mail-account>`
in place of your normal password.

That‚Äôs it!

   App passwords can only be viewed once.
   Make sure you‚Äôre totally finished adding your Gmail account to Zammad before clicking **Done**!
