Signatures
**********

You can create a separate signature for each group in Zammad. The individual signatures can be created and edited here:

.. image:: images/channels/Zammad_Helpdesk_-Signature.jpg

Afterwards, the existing (and active) signatures are available in the group editing mask:

.. image:: images/channels/Signature2.jpg

Each group can be assigned its own signature, but they can also all use the same signature. 

To individualize the signatures, it is possible to automatically loaded specific information into a signature via "Snippets". All information stored on the ticket, assigned customers or agents can be inserted. This makes it possible to design the signature individually. To load a list of possible snippets, press"::" (two colons) in the text field of the signature:

Here is an example of a signature-setting and and how it might actually look like:

Currently the snippets can only be loaded into already created tickets (status Zammad 2.5)
