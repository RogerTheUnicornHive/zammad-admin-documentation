Roles
*****

... are the aggregation of groups. These should represent the field of activity / functional description of the agent. A user can be active in several roles.

The assignment of rights directly via a group should be avoided when roles are used.

Admin
-----

An admin role usually has access to the the admin interface, but you can either give someone full access to the admin area (Admin - Admin Interface = yes) or you can distribute access to some areas only.
For example, you could choose someone as a "Text-Module-Coordinator" who is a normal agent, but coordinates all changes in this area. In this way the admin can be relieved.

You can give access to the following sections:

Agent
-----

You can selectively give agents access to communication and reporting functions:

In addition, access rights can be given to the individual groups:

**Common Use Cases:**

In the vast majority of cases, the agent role should simply be given the full permission:

This is the recommended default and should be used unless you have special requirements for the agent role.

Another common use case is the supervisor role, where the supervisor can freely view and modify tickets, just like an agent, but cannot be assigned as a ticket owner. This is done by selecting all four individual permissions:

.. csv-table:: Understanding Permissions
   :header: "Permission", "Description"
   :widths: 10, 20

   "READ", "Read only access to the tickets and entries of this group."
   "CREATE", "Right to create tickets or entries in this group."
   "CHANGE", "Right to change the attributes of tickets, entries or areas that belong to this group."
   "OVERVIEW", "Right to see tickets in the overviews. A view of the ticket details is not possible."
   "FULL", "Right to create, read, change and see tickets in the overviews."

.. hint:: | **I can't assign an agent as Owner?!** 
  | In order to assign an agent as Ticket-Owner, the agent needs **FULL** rights on the group, other wise this is not possible.


Here are a few examples of different combinations of rights:

This applies to group "Incoming" and allows the agent to read and edit its tickets. He can also search for those tickets and see them in overviews.
The agent **can't** create new tickets into the group "Incoming".

.. image:: images/manage/permission-examples-comb2.jpg

This applies to group "Incoming" and allows the agent to create new tickets to the group. He can also see the tickets in overviews.
The agent can't read or edit tickets of this group (also Bulk actions do not work). Searching for tickets inside of "Incoming" is also not possible.

.. image:: images/manage/permission-examples-comb3.jpg

The agent can read, search and edit tickets for the group "Incoming".
The tickets will not appear in the agent's overviews and the creation of new tickets doesn't work as well.


Customer
--------

Access to customer tickets based on current_user and organization
--> This checkbox gives the user access to his or her own tickets created in the ticket system. If the customer is a member of a "Shared Organization", he can also see the tickets of the shared organization.


User preferences
----------------

For each of both, agents and customers, you can define which areas are available in the user preferences:

These settings refer to the personal settings that can be set here:

hint
  If agents are not allowed to change their own passwords, you don't have to check "Password". In this case, only the admin can assign and change a password.


Default at signup
-----------------

One of the roles should be created as the "default role" (default at signup = yes). When someone registers in the system who has not before been registered in the system, this role is given to them.
This is usually the role "Customer". All other roles must be set to "no".

To keep an overall view of this, the field selection (yes/no) is displayed in a column in the role overview:
